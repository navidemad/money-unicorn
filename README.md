Ruby on Rails boilerplate for your "Money Automater" dashboardâ€”focusing initially on the YouTube Shorts Automater.

- [ ] Create a Short based on long-form content
- [ ] Subtitles for Shorts

i am not trying to make you hard work to be less worthy, just years of observation for this type of content.
